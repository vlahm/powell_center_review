1. run metadata xm through metadata parse: https://geo-nsdi.er.usgs.gov/validation/
2. scan through all
3. reread checklist and revisit parts as necessary
4. read through terms (see below) and see if theres anything surprisingly missing

not necessary because alison used metadata wizard? review doc already says "no fgdc schema errors found"

alison:
it looks like youre following: FGDC Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata
how will the metadata actually be viewed? rendered into human-readable text like in these word docs? if so, \n\t errors might be worth addressing
floating comments and edits in the text appropriate?

sites:
temporal keyword?
temporal extents?

things to note:
"all links tested"
"coordinates verified"
